**Version 5.4.20**

Fixed format and MIPs for 3 more textures.

**Version 5.4.19**

Fixed format of 0x165116B8. Thanks deadspear.

**Version 5.4.18**

Upscaled 10 new textures : 0x8B0D95D1 0x69E9A01A 0x9665E158 0x960F0565 0xE0D82D71 0x3DDFE45C 0xFADD0856 0xCC533A03 0x96546023 0x62F08FB8

Fixed a lense flare texture (0xCC533A03) to look better.

**Version 5.4.16**

Upscaled the Terminus armor to 4k (0xFC109EB8).

Updated some face textures (Tarshana). Full list too long to include here.

**Version 5.4.15**

Fixed an NPC dress (0x63FB32EF). The norm's UV channels were swapped.

**Version 5.4.14**

This update doesn't include changes from 5.4.13 and below. I keep both separated, as 5.4.13 is becoming quite big.

Alvaro fixed 2 alliance norms that weren't consistent with the diffs : 0x7C76F2CC, 0x2CE94E76

**Version 5.4.13**

All thanks to AlvaroMe : fixed several norms, which were corrupted by Photoshop, and ported one more norm from ME2.

**Version 5.4.12**

Changed 0x548E0D01, 0xB8C32EBF, 0xD4F2E377 (Tali's norm).

**Version 5.4.11**

Changed 0xBC01E495 to be more consistent with the vanilla game.

**Version 5.4.10**

Fixed Tali's default outfit's norm texture (0x548E0D01 0xD4F2E377). Also added an optional file with Alvaro's take on that norm, with comparison screenshots.

**Version 5.4.9**

Vanilla'd a texture I missed in the last update : 0xA0F579AF

Updated Aquarium TPF with new textures : 0xE6E82849 0xB8CABE4D 0xB07626B5 0x96572885. These textures are Not Found In Tree (NFIT) by ME3Explorer, but do exist in-game. The details are a bit too lengthy to explain here.

**Version 5.4.8**

More fixes related to face seams. All norms have been vanilla'd, since it has been found that facial norms were not upscaleable without seams.

Some new textures (diffs) have been added, too.

**Version 5.4.7**

A few face textures had a wrong alpha hue, should be fixed now.

**Version 5.4.6**

This update should mean the doom of face seams, finally. Over the course the last updates until this one, new textures (2048 diffs, 1024 norms) have been created for the character's faces. Many thanks to Tarshana (author of the textures) and AlvaroMe (great tester).

**Version 5.4.5**

Added more 2048 diffs by Tarshana.

Merged the Shepard Faces Texture Pack with the main pack. Tarshana's textures took precedence whenever there was a conflict.

**Version 5.4.4**

5.4.2 and 5.4.3 didn't work, so here is yet another try to fix the seams issue. This time, face norms have been vanilla'd (except for Shepard).

Added NEW 2048 face textures by Tarshana. Thank you !

**Version 5.4.3**

Fixed MIPs for the face norms.

Re-added 0xF3AFF836.

**Version 5.4.2**

Hopefully finally fixed the face seams. Swapped the UV channels of face norms : 0x2778401E 0x53C5F329 0xB2AD1655 0xB3C1D205 0xC7A64D1A 0xF3AFF836. Thanks Tarshana and AlvaroMe for helping out !

Reset 0x591A2F57 and 0xDE374303's brightness, that was changed before as an attempt to fix the face seams.

**Version 5.4.1**

Created custom norm to replace the ravager's current norm (0xAE74C0AF).

**Version 5.4**

- Removed Ottemis' textures from ALOT, as requested by her. List of textures removed : http://pastebin.ca/3707381 . If you still want to use them, you'll have to manually download Ottemis' mods from Nexus, then extract the textures from the TPFs, and cross check which ones I used in ALOT. I can't do anything more about it, sorry.
- Vanilla'd 0xAE74C0AF to fix the Ravager's texture.
- Removed 0x27D3DEDA, 0xB07626B5, 0xE6E82849 (NFIT). Removed 0x9B003FA9, 0x4C2EE763 (same size as vanilla).
- Included all previous patches.

Apparently Ottemis received hate messages since revoking permission for her textures. The decision has been made, and hating on her won't bring anything. She isn't the one at fault here, the mods are hers, she has the right to do anything she wants with them. For now, it can only be hoped that she will upload these textures as her own mod in the future. Negative messages certainly won't encourage her to do so, please consider it and avoid this childish behaviour.

**Version 5.3.12**

Modified some face textures with more vanilla-friendly alternatives from ELE08 (BSN mods).

Added a custom FemShep texture (0xF6BFD7B5) made by me with eyes from "eledefaultfemsheptex" and the rest of the face (incl brows) from "ME3 - Default Female", both by ELE08. I kept the most vanilla-friendly parts of each texture, basically.

Note to self : Remove 0x27D3DEDA, 0xB07626B5, 0xE6E82849 in next major update (NFIT). Remove 0x9B003FA9, 0x4C2EE763 (same size as vanilla).

List of edited textures : 0x10B2CD7B 0x31043827 0x3E6D12EC 0x6FF442DA 0x74366F67 0x90CA32B4 0xD2CB5050 0xEDC5BFE7 0xF02FAA7B 0xF1535C11 0xF1F8C949 0xF3AFF836 0xF6BFD7B5

- Regenerated ALL MIPMaps to make use of the enhanced MIP generation algorithms of ME3Explorer 2.0.

Aquarium.

Replaced 2 paintings with 2 of the removed ones above (0x7ADD5567, 0x9A6D6AE1)

**Version 5.0**

Massive update :
- Ported 165 textures from ALOT ME2 and MEUITM to ALOT ME3.
Basically, there are A LOT of textures that are strictly identical between the 3 games, and thus texture mods can often be used in more than one game, with just a bit of tweaking.

General cleanup :
- Includes all bugfixes from 4.3.4
- Removed 0x681EEF7C, 0x6DE908D1, 0x4BCF1D68, 0xC95D3ED8, 0x3FD3029E (textures that stray too far from vanilla)

Misc :

**Version 4.3.2**

Fixed problems with Console Panels by vanillaing 0x5D2725D5 and 0xEB24C657

Added an upscaled console texture to the Aquarium TPF (0x8BF84879)

Fixed the transparency of the Mohawk hair (0x9319C800), which is actually a bug in the vanilla game. Thanks Sonicck.

Fixed Tali's Default outfit (0xBE6438F1). The lack of an alpha made it look like glossy plastic.

Fixed Coalesced (Nvidia and AMD) by changing LODBias from -1 to 0 for "bioengine.ini>systemsettings>texturegroup_environment_512". Thanks EldradNerevar for the fix.

**Version 4.3.1**

Vanilla'd Eng_Console02_Diff (hash 0x5D2725D5), as the texture simply looks out of place.

Fixed bad MIPS generation for 4 textures (0x5D2725D5, 0x8BF84879, 0xD8613C4E, 0xF0629DB3) from 'Environment - Others' pack, that caused a stall in the installation.

Updated torrent links, mirrors and MD5 hashes.

**Version 4.1**

Rebuilt the entire METPF release, which was pretty much entirely corrupt.

Fixed the HGR_VISOR_HOLOGRAM texture (hash 0x5DEBFB67), from Shepard pack. Like the aquarium plants, this one cannot be upscaled with me3explorer. If you already installed the bad texture, use Texmod to overwrite it (see optional TPF). Thanks Samustus.

Updated the optional Aquarium TPF to include the Sentry Visor.

Updated torrent links, mirrors and MD5 hashes.

**Version 4.0**

Upscaled 35 textures with JeanLuc761's amazing ME2 character textures and other mods from ME2. Upscales go from 2x to 4x the previous size.

Updated torrent links, mirrors and MD5 hashes.

**Version 3.3.2**

Fixed format of Rubble01_Norm (hash 0xE05E9C5C) from Environment - Citadel pack. Thanks Tiress for reporting the problem.

FYI, Spec_Tile_A and LD_Spec_03 (hash 0x95BB720E) cannot be installed in rev717 due to a bug in me3explorer (rev717 detects a wrong format for these textures, thus considers them incorrect). If you really wish to install it, use rev731.

**Version 3.3.1**

Fixed a problem with Shepard's dress (hash 0xB2BCE1E0), that wasn't identical to it's Citadel DLC counterpart.
